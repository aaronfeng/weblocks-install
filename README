A self contained weblocks installation script for weblocks 0.8.3.

The script tries to be as idempotent as possible during the install, but
more work is probably required.  It should be consider safe to repeat the
script on an already created project.

* Usage:
  - Download and install all weblocks dependencies into the project:

    bash install-weblocks.sh your-project-name

  - Compile and run the project:

    cd your-project-name
    script/server

* Release Notes:
  - All dependencies are required by weblocks except for:

    slime-2009-09-12.tar.gz
    osicat-0.6.0.tar.gz
    linedit-0.16.1.tar.gz
    terminfo-1.3.tar.gz
    uffi-1.6.2.tar.gz
    lift-1.7.0.tar.gz

 - Removed version checking of osicat in linedit-0.16.1.
   Apparently *osicat-version* symbol is no longer available.
   Version checking should probably done at the asdf level.

* TODO:
  - check to see if threads are enabled for sbcl before compiling
  - add sbcl compile script for osx
