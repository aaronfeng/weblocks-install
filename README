A self contained weblocks installation script for weblocks 0.8.3

* Usage:
  - Download and install all weblocks dependencies into the project:

    bash install-weblocks.sh your-project-name

  - Compile and run the project:

    cd your-project-name
    script/server

* Note:
  The script tries to be as idempotent as possible during the install, but
  more work is probably required.
